        Cribbage is believed to have been invented by Sir John
Suckling (1609-1642).  Probably it is an elaboration of an older
game, Noddy.  The original game was played with hands of five
cards; the modern game gives each player six.  That is virtually
the only change from Suckling's directions.


_P_l_a_y_e_r_s.

        Two.  There are variants for three and four players,
described later.


_C_a_r_d_s.

        The pack of 52.  The cards in each suit rank: K (high),
Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A.  The _c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g _v_a_l_u_e_s are: K,
Q, J, 10, each 10 (wherefore these are called _t_e_n_t_h _c_a_r_d_s); ace,
1; each other card, its index value.


_C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e _B_o_a_r_d

        Indispensable to scoring (unless you have a computer!,
ed.) is the device known as the _c_r_i_b_b_a_g_e _b_o_a_r_d.  This is a rec-
tangular panel, long and narrow, in which are four rows of 30
holes each.  (See illustration.)  At one end, or in the center,
are two or four additional holes, called _g_a_m_e _h_o_l_e_s.  The board
is placed between the two players, and each keeps his own score
on the two rows of holes nearest himself.  Each is supplied with
two _p_e_g_s.  Before the first hand, the pegs are placed in the game
holes.  On making his first score, the player advances one peg an
appropriate number of holes (one per point) away from the _g_a_m_e
_e_n_d of the board.  The second score is recorded by placing the
second peg an appropriate distance ahead of the first.  For each
subsequent score, the rear peg is jumped ahead of the other, the
distance between the two pegs always showing the amount of this
last score.

        The traditional mode of scoring is down (away from the
game end) the outer row, and up the inner row.  "Once around" is
a game of 61 points.  "Twice around" is a game of 121 points.














_P_r_e_l_i_m_i_n_a_r_i_e_s.

        Cards are drawn; the lower deals first.  If cards of
equal rank are drawn, both players draw again.  Dealer has the
right to shuffle last.  Nondealer cuts, and must leave at least
four cards in each packet.


_D_e_a_l_i_n_g.

        Each player receives six cards, dealt one at a time face
down, beginning with the nondealer.  The turn to deal alternates.
The dealer has an advantage.


_L_a_y_i_n_g _A_w_a_y.

        After seeing his hand, each player _l_a_y_s _a_w_a_y two cards
face down.  The four cards laid away, placed in one pile, form
the _c_r_i_b.  The crib counts for the dealer.  Nondealer therefore
tries to lay away _b_a_l_k_i_n_g _c_a_r_d_s -- cards that are least likely to
create a score in the crib.


_T_h_e _S_t_a_r_t_e_r.

        After both hands have laid away, nondealer lifts off a
packet from the top of the _s_t_o_c_k (the rest of the pack).  Again,
each packet must contain at least four cards.  Dealer turns up
the top card of the lower packer, which is then placed on top of
the stock when the packets are reunited.  The card thus turned up
is called _1 _t_h_e _s_t_a_r_t_e_r.  If it is a jack, dealer immediately
pegs 2, called _2 _f_o_r _h_i_s _h_e_e_l_s.


_T_h_e _P_l_a_y.

        Nondealer begins the play by laying a card from his hand
face up on the table, announcing its counting value.  Dealer then
shows a card, announcing the total count of the two cards.  Play
continues in the same way, by alternate exposure of cards, each
player announcing the new total count.  The total may be carried
only to 31, no further.  If a player adds a card that brings the
total exactly to 31, he pegs 2.  If a player is unable to play
another card without exceeding 31, he must say "Go," and his op-
ponent pegs 1, but before doing so, opponent must lay down any
additional cards he can without exceeding 31.  If such additional
cards bring the total to exactly 31, he pegs 2 instead of 1.

        Whenever a _g_o occurs, the opponent of the player who
played the last card must lead for a new count starting at zero.
Playing the last card of all counts as a go.  (Since nondealer
makes the opening lead, dealer is bound to peg at least 1 in
play.)


                              - 2 -









        Besides pegging for 31 and go, the player may also peg
for certain combinations made in play, as follows:


    _F_i_f_t_e_e_n.

            Making the count total 15 pegs 2.


    _P_a_i_r.

            Playing a card of same rank as that previously
    played pegs 2.  Playing a third card of the same rank
    makes _p_a_i_r _r_o_y_a_l and pegs 6.  Playing the fourth card of
    the same rank makes _d_o_u_b_l_e _p_a_i_r _r_o_y_a_l and pegs 12.

            The tenth cards pair strictly by rank, a king
    with a king, a queen with a queen, and so on.  (King and
    jack do not make a pair, although each has the counting
    value 10.)


    _R_u_n.

            Playing a card which, with the two or more played
    immediately previously, makes a sequence of three or more
    cards, pegs 1 for each card in the _r_u_n.  Runs depend on
    rank alone; the suits do not matter.  Nor does the score
    for run depend upon playing the cards in strict sequence,
    so long as the three or more last cards played can be ar-
    ranged in a run.  _E_x_a_m_p_l_e: 7, 6, 8 played in that order
    score 3 for run; 5, 2, 4, 3 played in that order score 4
    for run.

        Any of the foregoing combinations count, whether the
cards are played alternately or one player plays several times in
succession in consequence of a go.  But a combination does not
score if it is interrupted by a go.


_S_h_o_w_i_n_g.

        After the play, the hands are _s_h_o_w_n (counted).  Nondealer
shows first, then dealer's hand, then crib.  The starter is
deemed to belong to each hand, so that each hand includes five
cards.  Combinations of scoring value are as follows:


    _F_i_f_t_e_e_n.

            Each combinations of two or more cards that total
    fifteen scores 2.




                              - 3 -









    _P_a_i_r.

            Each pair of cards of the same rank scores 2.


    _R_u_n.

            Each combination of three or more cards in se-
    quence scores 1 for each card in the run.


    _F_l_u_s_h.

            Four cards of the same suit in hand score 4; four
    cards in hand or crib of same suit as the starter score
    5.  (No count for four-flush in crib.)


    _H_i_s _N_o_b_s.

            Jack of same suit as the starter, in hand or
    crib, scores 1.

        It is important to note that every separate grouping of
cards that makes a fifteen, pair, or run counts separately.
Three of a kind, _p_a_i_r _r_o_y_a_l, counts 6 because three sets of pairs
can be made; similarly, four of a kind, _d_o_u_b_l_e _p_a_i_r _r_o_y_a_l, con-
tain six pairs and count 12.

        The highest possible hand is J, 5, 5, 5 with the starter
the 5 of the same suit as the jack.  There are four fifteens by
combining the jack with a five, four more by combinations of
three fives (a total of 16 for fifteens); the double pair royal
adds 12 for a total of 28; and _h_i_s _n_o_b_s adds 1 for a maximum
score of 29.  (the score of 2 for _h_i_s _h_e_e_l_s does not count in the
total of the hand, since it is pegged before the play.)

        A _d_o_u_b_l_e _r_u_n is a run with one card duplicated, as 4-3-
3-2.  Exclusive of fifteens, a double run of three cards counts
8; of four cards, 10.  A _t_r_i_p_l_e _r_u_n is a run of three with one
card triplicated, as K-K-K-Q-J.  Exclusive of fifteens, it counts
15.  A _q_u_a_d_r_u_p_l_e _r_u_n is a run of three with two different cards
duplicated, as the example 8-8-7-6-6 previously given.  Exclusive
of fifteens, it counts 16.

        No hand can be constructed that counts 19, 25, 26 or 27.
A time-honored way of showing a hand with not a single counting
combination is to say "I have nineteen."

        The customary oder in showing is to count fifteens first,
then runs, then pairs, but there is no compulsion of law.  _E_x_a_m_-
_p_l_e: A hand (with starter) of 9-6-5-4-4 will usually be counted
"Fifteen 2, fifteen 4, fifteen 6 and double run makes 14," or
simply "Fifteen 6 and 8 is 14."


                              - 4 -









_M_u_g_g_i_n_s.

        The hands and crib are counted aloud, and if a player
claims a greater total than is due him, his opponent may require
correction.  In some localities, if a player claims less than is
due, his opponent may say "Muggins" and himself score the points
overlooked.


_S_c_o_r_i_n_g.

        The usual _g_a_m_e is 121, but it may be set at 61 by agree-
ment.  Since the player wins who first returns to the game hole
by going "twice around," the scores must be pegged strictly in
order: his heels, pegging in play, non-dealer's hand, dealer's
hand, crib.  Thus, if nondealer goes out on showing his hand, he
wins, even though dealer might have gone out with a greater total
if allowed to count his hand and crib.

        When the game of 121 is played for a stake, a player wins
a single game if the loser makes 61 points or more.  If the loser
fails to reach 61, he is _l_u_r_c_h_e_d, and the other wins a double
game.


_I_r_r_e_g_u_l_a_r_i_t_i_e_s.

        _M_i_s_d_e_a_l.  There must be a new deal by the same dealer if
a card is found faced in the pack, if a card is exposed in deal-
ing, or if the pack be found imperfect.

        _W_r_o_n_g _N_u_m_b_e_r _o_f _C_a_r_d_s.  If one hand (not crib) is found
to have the wrong number of cards after laying away for the crib,
the other hand and crib being correct, the opponent may either
demand a new deal or may peg 2 and rectify the hand.  If the crib
is incorrect, both hands being correct, nondealer pegs 2 and the
crib is corrected.


_E_r_r_o_r _i_n _P_e_g_g_i_n_g.

        If a player places a peg short of the amount to which he
is entitled, he may not correct his error after he has played the
next card or after the cut for the next deal.  If he pegs more
than his announced score, the error must be corrected on demand
at any time before the cut for the next deal and his opponent
pegs 2.


_S_t_r_a_t_e_g_y.

        The best balking cards are kings and aces, because they
have the least chance of producing sequences.  Tenth cards are
generally good, provided that the two cards laid away are not too


                              - 5 -









_n_e_a_r (likely to make a sequence).  When nothing better offers,
give two _w_i_d_e cards -- at least three apart in rank.

        Proverbially the safest lead is a 4.  The next card can-
not make a 15.  Lower cards are also safe from this point of
view, but are better treasured for go and 31.  The most dangerous
leads are 7 and 8, but may be made to trap the opponent when they
are backed with other close cards.  Generally speaking, play _o_n
(toward a sequence) when you have close cards and _o_f_f when you do
not.  However, the state of the score is a consideration.  If far
behind, play on when there is any chance of building a score for
yourself; if well ahead, balk your opponent by playing off unless
you will surely peg as much as he by playing on.
