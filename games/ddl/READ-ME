aard.ddl:		A complete, but slightly uninspired, DDL dungeon
ddlcomp:		Binary (Vax VMUnix) for the DDL "compiler"
ddlrun:			Binary (Vax VMUnix) for the DDL runtime processor

	Directories:
doc:			Documentation
sample:			Sources for a incomplete dungeon demonstrating some
			   more sophisticated uses of DDL

The documentation files doc.ms and builtins.ms should be run
through tbl and troff (eg tbl doc.ms builtins.ms|troff -ms).
