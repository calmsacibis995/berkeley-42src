Rogue installation:

In order to install your rogue game, you should read mach_dep.c,
wherein are located comments which tell you what tunable variables
there are.  When you wish to create a rogue, type:

	cc -s <defines...> distmod.o mach_dep.c -lcurses -ltermlib

This will create a stripped a.out for you to run.  You should
initialize the score file by copying /dev/null to it.  Rogue is set up
so that it can be run setuid; either the score file must be writeable
by anyone or rogue must be setuid and the score file must be owned by
that user.

The file rogue.doc is can be nroffed thusly:

	tbl rogue.doc | nroff -me -h | col

and the output should probably be saved somewhere, since everyone
will want to look at it.  Also included in the archive is a file
("rogue.new") which briefly explains the changes from 5.2 to create
5.3.  This will be useful for rogue hacks who don't want to read the
whole documentation, although I'd recommend that they do at first.
It is also recommended to play a few games in noterse mode at first.

			  ==== NOTE ===

THIS VERSION OF ROGUE WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE THE FIXED VERSION
OF CURSES DISTRIBUTED IN "NET.SOURCES".  If you don't have access to
this version, you will have to get it from somewhere.  I can provide
copies, and it should be distributed with 4.2bsd UN*X.
