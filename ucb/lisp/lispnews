Subject: new features
Status: RO

 In response to requests from franz users, these enhancements have been
made:

In Lisp 38.07,  if the lisp variable 'displace-macros' is set to non-nil,
then when a macro expansion is done by the evaluator, the resulting
expansion replaces the original call.  This means that macro expansion
is only done once.  

In Liszt 8.03, the 'function' function is open coded.  If you have
	(function (lambda ....))
in your code then the lambda expression is compiled as a separate function
and the result of the function call is a 'bcd' object which points
to that compiled lambda.

 The new features of this version are:
	If the load function ends up fasl'ing in a file, then load will
  do what is necessary to insure that the new functions are linked in
  correctly. Previously, if you turned on the transfer tables with
  (sstatus translink on) or (sstatus translink t) and then fasl'ed in
  functions which already existed, the old versions of the functions
  would still be used, unless you did (sstatus translink on) yourself.
  Now this is done automatically.

      tyi now accepts a second argument which is the object to return
  upon eof.  -1 is the default.

     (pp-form 'g_obj ['p_port]) should be used instead of $prpr
 for pretty printing a form.

     The storage allocator and collector has been modified to add
 two new data types: vector and vector immediate.  They are not in
 their final form so I suggest that you not try to use them. 
 However, be on the lookout for garbage collection bugs.

Subject: liszt 8.04
Status: RO

  the new features of liszt 8.04 are:

1) init files:
    Before liszt begins compiling, it looks for an init file to load in.
    It first searches in the current directory, and then it searches
    your home directory (getenv 'HOME).
    It looks for file names:
	.lisztrc.o  .lisztrc.l  lisztrc.o lisztrc.l
    It loads only the first one it finds.

2) interrupt handling
    If you interrupt liszt  (with ^C typically), it will remove its
    temporary file and exit.

3) preallocation of space
    It preallocates space in order to reduce the number of gc's done
    during compiling.

 lisp will now look for a lisprc in a way similar to liszt.

 It will first search in . and then in $HOME
 It will look for the file .lisprc or lisprc ending with .o, .l and then
just .lisprc or lisprc.

 Shortly, it will only look for files ending in .l and .o since we don't
want to encourage files with non-standard filename extensions.

 I finally got sick of showstack and baktrace and rewrote them in lisp,
rincorporating some of the features people have been requesting.
Showstack now works as follows:
	(showstack) : show all interesting forms.  Forms resulting from
		      the trace package are not printed as well as 
		      extraneous calls to eval.  In the form printed,
		      the special form <**> means 'the previous expression
		      printed'.  prinlevel and prinlength are set to 
		      reasonable values to prevent the expression from
		      getting too large
	(showstack t) : same as above but print all expressions.
	(showstack 5) : print only the first 5 expressions. of course, 5
		      is not the only possible numeric argument.
	(showstack lev 3) : set prinlevel to 3 before printing
	(showstack len 4) : set prinlength to 4 before printing
 the above arguments can be used in combination.

The default value of prinlevel is showstack-prinlevel, that of prinlength
is showstack-prinlength.  the default showstack printer is the
value of showstack-printer (default is 'print').

baktrace accepts the same arguments as showstack, but it ignores the
prinlevel and prinlength arguments.

Status: RO

  these changes and enhancements were made:

1) the function 'function' in the interpreter acts just like 'quote'
   In the compiler, 'function' will act like 'quote' unless the
   argument is a lambda expression, in which case liszt will replace
   the lambda expression with a unique symbol.  That unique symbol's
   function cell will contain a compiled version of the lambda 
   expression.   These changes will make Franz compatible with Maclisp
   type lisps, as far as the treatment of 'function'

2) Mechanisms were added to permit user written C or Fortran code to call 
   lisp code. Everything isn't quite ready yet.

3) Signal was fixed so that if you ask for a signal to be ignored, the
   operating system will be notified.  The correct way to fork a lisp
   is now:
	(cond ((fork) (signal 2 (prog1 (signal 2) (wait)))))

4) You can select the default function trace uses to print the arguments and
   results.  Just lambda bind trace-printer to the name of the function
   you want it to use.  The standard trace-printer sets prinlevel and
   prinlength to the values of trace-prinlevel and trace-prinlength before
   printing.  By default, trace-prinlevel is 4, and trace-prinlength is 5

 Local declarations are now supported.  You can say:
(defun foo (a b)
   (declare (special a))
   ... body ...)

and the special declaration for 'a' will affect the body of function
foo only.  The 'a' which is an argument to foo will also be special
in this case.    Declarations may be 
 1) at the top level, not within a function body.
 2) at the beginning of a  'lambda' body.
 3) at the beginning of a 'prog' body
 4) at the beginning of a 'do' body.

'the beginning' means either the first, second or third form in the body.
When the compiler is searching for declarations, it will not macroexpand.


 Fixnum declarations now have meaning.  If you do
	(declare (fixnum i j))
then
	(greaterp i  j)  will be converted to (>& i j)

 The declare function is now defined in the compiler.  Previously,
the only way to declare something was for the compiler to 'compile'
the declaration form.  Now, if you load or fasl in a file with
a declare statement in it, the declare statement will have the
proper effect in the compiler.


 (function (lambda () ...)), (function (nlambda () ...)) and
 (function (lexpr () ...))  are all supported.

  Liszt will now check that you are passing the correct number of arguments
to functions.   As a result, some files which have compiled without
complaint in the past may compile now with warnings or errors.  In this
note, I'll explain what the compiler knows, what it looks for in your
program, and how you can help the compiler understand your program.

  For each function, liszt either knows nothing about the the number of
arguments to a function, or it knows the minimum number of arguments, or the
maximum number of arguments, or both the minimum and maximum number of
arguments.   This information comes about in one of three ways:
  1) it is known when liszt starts (by virtue of a value stored under the
     fcn-info indicator on a function's property list)
  2) it is declared by the user, either via (declare (*arginfo ...))
     or (declare (*args ...)) [see below]
  3) it is determined when a (lambda) function is compiled.
     When a lambda is compiled, the compiler can easily figure out the
       minimum and maximum number of arguments.
     When an nlambda or lexpr function is compiled, the compiler doesn't
     make a guess as to how many arguments are expected.  The user should
     use the (declare (*args ...)) form to tell the compiler how many
     arguments are expected.
     For lexpr's generated via 'defun' using &optional and &rest keywords,
     the correct declaration is generated automatically.
Once liszt determines the number of arguments to a function, it uses that
information to check that the function is called with the correct number of
arguments.  It does not check calls to the function that occured before it
determined the correct number of arguments.  [This backward checking will
be added sometime in the future.]

  If liszt finds that a function is called with the wrong number of
arguments, it prints an informative message.  That message is a error if the
function being called is one which is open coded by the compiler. The
message is a warning otherwise.  The reason for the distinction is that
you are free to redefine functions not open coded by the compiler. If the
number of arguments is not correct, it may just be that the compiler's
database and your code are refering to two different functions.
If you redefine system functions, you should use the
(declare (*arginfo ...)) form to let the compiler know about the number
of arguments expected by your version of the functions.

  You can declare the number of arguments to functions using this form

(declare (*arginfo (fcnname1 min1 max1) (fcnname2 min2 max2) ...))
  where each min or max is either a fixnum or nil (meaning "I don't know")
  
for example, here are some `correct' declarations:

(declare (*arginfo (read 0 2) (cons 2 2) (boole 3 nil) (append nil nil)))
  
 explanation:
   (read 0 2) means that the function read expects between 0 and 2
   	arguments (inclusive).
   (cons 2 2) means that cons expects 2 arguments.
   (boole 3 nil) means that boole expects at least 3 arguments.
   (append nil nil) means that append expects any number of arguments,
      this is equivalent to (append 0 nil).
      

The *arginfo declaration is usually made at the top level of a file.

To declare the argument characteristics of the current function being
compiled use the '*args' declaration. It looks somewhat like the
*arginfo declaration.

It is best explained with examples

(def read
   (lexpr (n)
       (declare (*args 0 2))
       ... code for read
       ))

(def process
  (nlambda (x)
      (declare (*args 1 3))
      ... code for process
      ))

Note: the *args declaration is not needed for lambda's.



  If you get an error or warning which you believe is incorrect, it is
probably due to an incorrect database entry.  Please let me know and I will
fix it immediately.   I expect that there will be quite a few of these
errors because much of the database was built by hand.

There are now three new functions for dealing with processes:
  *process
  *process-send
  *process-receive

 These functions are designed to replace the 'process' function, which, due
to its nlambda'ness, was difficult to use.  All of the above functions
are lambda's or lexpr's.

  See chapter 6 of the manual (its on-line) for the details of these
functions.  This is a quick summary:

  (*process-send 'st_command)
  tells the shell to run the command st_command concurrently, and returns
  a write-only port.  Characters written to this port will appear at
  the standard input of st_command.
  example:
     (setq p (*process-send "mail jkf"))
     (print 'HiThere p)
     (close p)

     
  (*process-receive 'st_command)
  tells the shell to run st_command concurrently, and returns a
  read-only port.  Characters written to the standard output by
  st_command will be available by reading from the given port.
  Characters written on the standard error by st_command will
  appear on lisp's the standard error (the terminal most likely).
  example:
    ; to see if foo is logged in:
    (setq p (*process-receive "u"))
    (do ((user (read p '**eof**) (read p '**eof**)))
        ((eq '**eof** user) (print 'Not-Logged-In))
	(cond ((eq 'foo user) (print 'Is-Logged-In))))
    (close p)


  (*process 'st_command ['g_readp ['g_writep]])
  this is the general function which process, *process-send and
  *process-receive call.  If called with one argument it
  starts the new process and waits for it to end, e.g:
  (*process (concat "vi " filename))
  In this case *process return the exit code of the process.

  The g_readp and g_writep arguments, if given, tell *process to
  run the process concurrently.  If g_read is non nil then
  *process will return a port just like *process-receive.
  If g_writep is non-nil, then *process will set up a pipe like
  *process-send.
  *process will return a list of the form
    (readport writeport process-id)
    where readport and writeport will only be a port if g_readp
    or g_writep are non nil.


 A little know fact about processes is that  a process, once started,
cannot die and disappear until its parent asks about its status.
Take the mail example given above:
     (setq p (*process-send "mail jkf"))
     (print 'HiThere p)
     (close p)
after the mail process finishes it work, it will attempt to die, returning
an integer called the 'exit status'.  However until the lisp program
asks about its status the mail process will remain in existence
in a Zombie state, somewhere between life and death. ps will show this:

  PID TT STAT  TIME COMMAND
 3876 p0 Z     0:01 <exiting>

A user is only allowed a small number of processes, so if you continue
to generate processes and leave them around as Zombies, you will eventually
run out of processes.  The way to let the Zombie die is to call
the wait function, e.g.
    -> (wait)
    (3876 . 0)
    -> 
this says that process 3876 died with exit status 0.

Also, when you exit lisp the shell will clean up the Zombies.

If you start a  process with (*process "vi foo") then lisp will wait
for it to complete before continuing, so you don't have to worry about
Zombies.  You only have to worry if you run a process concurrently,
such as when you use *process-send or *process-receive.

Topic 1:
    liszt can now autoload macros.   If liszt encounters a symbol without
    a function definition but with a macro-autoload indicator on the
    property list, then the value of the indicator is a file to load which
    should define the macro.

    The interpreter's undefined function handler will also look for
    macro-autoload properties, thus you needn't give a symbol both an
    autoload and a macro-autoload property.

    The default lisp contains macro-autoload properties for the macros
    defstruct, loop and defflavor.

Topic 2:
    It is now possible to define 'compiler only macros' or cmacros.
    A cmacro acts like a normal macro, but will only be used by the
    compiler.   A cmacro is stored on the property list of a
    symbol under the indicator 'cmacro'.    Thus a function can
    have a normal definition and a cmacro definition.
    The macro 'defcmacro' has a syntax identical to 'defmacro' and
    creates cmacros instead of macros.
    For an example of the use of cmacros, see the definitions
    of nthcdr and nth in /usr/lib/lisp/common2.l

 Topic 3:
    If the form (foo ...) is macro expanded and the result also begins
    with the symbol foo, then liszt will stop macro expanding (previously
    it got into an infinite loop).
    
 Topic 4:
    The function nth has been added to Franz.
    (nth 'x_index 'l_list)
    returns the nth element of l_list, where the car of the list
    is accessed with (nth 0 'l_list)

    The macros (push 'g_value 'g_stack), and
    	       (pop 'g_stack ['g_into])
    have been added to franz.
    typical uses
      (setq foo nil)
      (push 'xxx foo)
      (push 123 foo)
      now foo = (123 xxx)
      (pop foo) returns 123
      now foo = (xxx)
      (pop foo yyy) returns xxx and sets yyy to xxx

      
 Topic 5:
    The version of Flavors written at Mit for Franz have been transported
    here.  Flavors is a system for doing object oriented programming in
    lisp.  The documentation for flavors in the Lisp Machine manual
    from Mit.  Since Lisp Machine manuals are rather scarce around here,
    perhaps we can find someone to make copies of the flavor chapter for
    those interested in it.  There is a description of the unique
    features of the Franz Flavors in /usr/lib/lisp/flavors.usage.
    As mentioned above, the flavors code will be autoloaded
    when you call 'defflavor' for the first time.
    Our local flavors expert is Eric Cooper (r.ecc).

  Franz lisp now has a form of closure called an fclosure.  A fclosure is a
compromise between a funarg and the type of functional object that we
currently have in Franz. In this short note, I'll explain through examples
what fclosures are and where you might use them, and finally describe the new
functions.  The fclosure system was designed to be compatible with the Lisp
Machine closures, so you may want to look at a Lisp Machine manual for more
information.  fclosure are related to closures in this way:
   (fclosure '(a b) 'foo) <==> (let ((a a) (b b)) (closure '(a b) 'foo))

A example of the use of fclosures:

->(setq counter 0)
0
->(setq x (fclosure '(counter) '(lambda (val) (setq counter (+ val counter)))))
fclosure[1]

The function 'fclosure' creates a new type of object called a fclosure.
A fclosure object contains a functional object, and a set of symbols and
values for the symbols.  In the above example, the fclosure functional
object is (lambda (val) (setq counter (+ val counter)))
and the set of symbols and values just contains the symbol 'counter' and
zero, the value of counter when the fclosure was created.

When  a fclosure is funcall'ed:
  1) the lisp system lambda binds the symbols in the fclosure to their
     values in the fclosure.
  2) it continues the funcall on the functional object of the fclosure
  3) finally it un-lambda binds the symbols in the fclosure and at the
     same time stores the current values of the symbols in the fclosure.

To see what that means, let us continue the example:
-> (funcall x 32)
32
-> (funcall x 21)
53

Notice that the fclosure is saving the value of the symbol 'counter'.
Each time a fclosure is created, new space is allocated for saving
the values of the symbols.
If we executed the same fclosure function:
->(setq y (fclosure '(counter) '(lambda (val) (setq counter (+ val counter)))))
fclosure[1]

We now have two independent counters:
-> (funcall y 2)
2
-> (funcall y 12)
14
-> (funcall x 3)
56

To summarize:

(fclosure 'l_vars 'g_funcobj)
 l_vars is a list of symbols (not containing nil)
 g_funcobj is lambda expression or a symbol or another fclosure

  examples: (fclosure '(foo bar baz) 'plus)
            (fclosure '(a b) #'(lambda (x) (plus x a))) notice the #'
	   		which will make the compiler compile the
			lambda expression.


There are time when you want to share variables between fclosures.
This can be done if the fclosures are created at the time times using
fclosure-list:

(fclosure-list 'l_vars1 'g_funcobj1 ['l_vars2 'g_funcobj2 ... ...])
  This creates a list of closures such that if a symbol appears in
  l_varsN and l_varsM then its value will be shared between the
  closures associated with g_funcobjN and g_funcobjM.

  example: -> (setq x (fclosure-list '(a) '(lambda (y) (setq a y))
			             '(c a) '(lambda () (setq c a))))
	    (fclosure[4] fclosure[7])
	   -> (funcall (car x) 123)   ; set the value of a in the 1st fclosure
	   123
	   -> (funcall (cadr x))     ; read the same value in the 2nd fclosure
	   123


Other fclosure functions:

(fclosure-alist 'c_fclosure)
  returns an assoc list giving the symbols and values in the fclosure

(fclosurep 'g_obj)
  returns t iff g_obj is a fclosure

(fclosure-function 'c_fclosure)
  returns the functional object of the fclosure



Note: If a throw (or error) occurs during the evaluation of a fclosure,
 which passes control out of the fclosure, then current values of the
 symbols will not be stored.   This may be a bug.  We could set up
 an unwind-protect, but it would then take longer to funcall
 a fclosure.  If you think an unwind protect is important, let me know.

Note 2: you can also 'apply' a fclosure.

  I sent the maryland people the flavors.usage file from mit so that they
could compare their implementation with mit's.   What follows is their
analysis.   Some of the differences between the two versions is due to
different schemes for getting around the fact that franz didn't have a form
of closure.   RZ has indicated that now that franz has fclosures, it may be
possible to use more of the 'official' lisp machine flavor code.  fclosures
will probably affect the maryland implementation too:

Wow, implementing closure in one day is amazing.  We had thought
about writing some kind of closure...  We've been discussing how
having closures would affect our code.  It might make it easier to
read and modify, but it might be less efficient.  Can you tell us
how your implementation works and what it looks like to a user?

About the MIT implementation.  Ours is probably better in a couple
of respects but probably loses a couple of places, too.  Pros:

	1.  With ours, there is no need to discard instances when
	redefining a flavor.  The only time this would be necessary
	is if the instance variables change which rarely happens
	since methods change much more often than the instance
	variables.  Without a structure editor, you tend to reload the
	file containing flavors in order to change a method.

	2.  We can compile files with flavors (he didn't say if you
	can compile MIT's Franz flavors) and when they are compiled
	they run *fast*.  Most of the overhead occurs at combine
	time and compiled flavors shouldn't have to be recombined.

	3.  We use hunks to store instance variables (actually, an
	instance is a hunk whose cxr 0 is the name of the flavor and
	whose cxr n (> 0) are the values of instance variables).  We
	pay a price at combine time since instance variable references
	in method code are replaced with cxr and rplacx calls (but MIT
	pays the same price in putting hash calls in the methods), but
	we win over MIT since the cxr calls are much faster than the
	hash table calls.  We do have to have "ghost" methods which
	are copies of methods containing different cxr calls when the
	referenced variables of a method don't align in flavors
	which inherit the method.  This, however, happens only
	rarely.

	4.  We handle getting and setting instance variables better
	than the MIT implementation -- we don't need to send a message
	and the syntax is much better.  We recently added the
	functions << and >> which get and set instance variables, eg:

		(<< foo 'instance-var)
	and
		(>> foo 'instance-var 'value)

	where foo is a flavor instance.

	5.  Our describe function has a hook which (if the variable
	*debugging-flavors* is set to non-nil) allows the user to
	follow pointers to any instances referenced in the describe.
	This is done by assigning to a variable (made from its unique
	id) the value of the instance.

Cons:

	1.  They implement more things from Lisp Machine flavors
	(like wrappers/whoppers, init-keywords), but we really haven't
	found the need for them.  We implement less closely to LM
	flavors, but in a way that's better suited to Franz Lisp.

	2.  We didn't implement the method table as a hash table, but
	there's no reason why we couldn't.

	3.  Things we don't have, but could easily implement include:
	describe-method, defun-method/declare-flavor-instance-variables,
	and storing flavor information in hunks instead of on the
	property lists.

	4.  We don't handle method types like :and and :or.  We just
	have primary/untyped methods and :before and :after daemons.

We have people reading our documentation.  After we get some feedback
from them, we'll send the tape and docs to you.  That should be early
next week.

New features:
 1) tilde-expansion:  franz will now expand filenames which begin with ~
	just like csh does.  It will only do the expansion if
	the symbol tilde-expansion has a non-nil value.  The default
	value for tilde-expansion is t.
	These functions do tilde expansion: If I've left any out, let
	me know:
	 load, fasl, infile, outfile, fileopen, probef, cfasl, ffasl, chdir
	 sys:access, sys:unlink [these are new functions, see below]

 2) liszt will remove its temporary file if given a SIGTERM signal
    (SIGTERM is sent by default when you give the kill command from the shell)

 3) load will now print a helpful message if an read error occurs when it
    is reading a file.
    
 4) new functions:

     (lexpr-funcall 'function 'arg1 ... 'argn)
        This is a cross between funcall and apply.
	The last argument, argn, must be a list (possibly empty).
	The element of list argn are stacked and then the function is
	funcalled.
	For example:
	(lexpr-funcall 'list 'a 'b 'c '(d e f))
	is the same as
	(funcall 'list 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e 'f)
	
	Also
	(lexpr-funcall 'list 'a 'b 'c nil)
	is the same as
	(funcall 'list 'a 'b 'c)
 	
     (tilde-expand 'st_filename)
     returns: symbol whose pname is the filename, with a leading tilde
     	     expanded.  if st_filename doesn't begin with a tilde, it
	     just returns st_filename

     (username-to-dir 'st_name)
     returns: the home directory of the given user, if that user exists.
     	      Saves old information so doesn't have to keep searching
	      the passwd file.

     Some low level system functions.  These are listed here for completeness.
     The perform a function from the unix library (see the unix manual
      for details).
     (sys:getpwnam 'st_username)
       return passwd file info.
     (sys:access 'st_file 'x_mode)
     (sys:unlink 'st_file)


Bug fixes:
  1) patom will handle prinlevel and prinlength correctly.
  2) it is now safe for an interpreted function to redefine itself.
  3) the information return by 'evalframe' about a funcall'ed function
     is now correct.

  Would anyone object if we added a macro called 'if' to the default franz
system?   'if' is a common name and I want to make sure that it doesn't
break any existing code before I add it.

Some background:
 At mit the 'if' macro is used all over the place.
 Its form is
 	(if <predicate> <then-expr> [ <else-expr>])
	
 I've always felt that macros should make the code more readable and
 that the 'if' macro makes code more obscure because it isn't easy
 to tell in complicated 'if' expressions where the <then-expr>
 and <else-expr>'s begin.  Also, there is no provision for
 an 'elseif' expression.

 I wrote a macro called 'If' which uses keywords to separate clauses.
 (If <pred> 
    then <then-expr> 
  [elseif <pred> then <then-expr>]* 
  [else <else-expr>])

 These two macros are not incompatible.  one macro could do the job
 of both.  There is an ambigous case:
	(if p then x) could be (cond (p then) (t x))
			or (cond (p x))
 but it isn't likely that 'if' macro users would write something like
 that.

Thus I propose that we add a macro, if, which act's like 'If' if
its second arg is 'then' or like 'if' it the second arg is not 'then'
and there are two or three arguments.  Other cases would cause
an error.

  I've added the 'if' macro to franz.  If you have any objections, it is still
not too late to voice them.
  I've also defined 'If' to be the same as 'if'.

  As I mentioned in my earlier request for comments, the 'if' macro is a
cross between the mit version and a locally written version using keywords.
The following documentation describes the various forms.
As you know, you can test out the 'if' macro by using apply. for example:

=> (apply 'if '(if a then b c  elseif d thenret else e))
(cond (a b c) (d) (t e))


;
;  This macro is compatible with both the crufty mit-version and
; the keyword version at ucb.
;
;  simple summary:
;   non-keyword use:
;	(if a b) ==> (cond (a b))
;	(if a b c d e ...) ==> (cond (a b) (t c d e ...))
;   with keywords:
;	(if a then b) ==> (cond (a b))
;	(if a thenret) ==> (cond (a))
;	(if a then b c d e) ==> (cond (a b c d e))
;	(if a then b c  else d) ==> (cond (a b c) (t d))
;	(if a then b c  elseif d  thenret  else g)
;		==> (cond (a b c) (d) (t g))
;
;   
;
;
; In the syntax description below,
;    optional parts are surrounded by [ and ],
;    + means one or more instances.
;    | means 'or'
;    <expr> is an lisp expression which isn't a keyword
;       The keywords are:  then, thenret, else, elseif.
;    <pred> is also a lisp expression which isn't a keyword.
; 
; <if-stmt> ::=  <simple-if-stmt>
; 	       | <keyword-if-stmt>
; 
; <simple-if-stmt> ::=  (if <pred> <expr>)
; 		      | (if <pred> <expr> <expr>)
; 
; <keyword-if-stmt> ::= (if <pred> <then-clause> [ <else-clause> ] )

  Since Franz now has the push, pop, if and msg macros, there is no
reason for jkfmacs to exist.  I've removed the code in jkfmacs and
replaced it with a warning message which will be printed if you load it.
  If you used the jkfmacs version of 'push' you will have to go through
your code and switch the order of arguments.  The Franz version is
	(push value stack)
Also, the unpush macro, defined in jkfmacs, no longer exists: just use
pop with one argument.

  Back on May 6, a modification to liszt was made which turned 'declare'
into a user callable function which provided information to the compiler.
The purpose of the change was to permit one to 'load' a file containing
declarations, instead of 'include'ing it.  It turns out that this was a bad
idea since if the compiler were to evaluate an interpreted function with
local declarations, it would assume that those local declarations were
describing the current file being compiled.
   Thus declare has it old meaning: it is a no-op unless the compiler is
compiling the form.  If one really wants to actively declare something,
we've added the function 'liszt-declare', which looks just like declare
but can be evaluated within the compiler.

  If you are confused by all this, don't worry.  There is very little chance
that it will affect you.

  A week ago, Joe Faletti mentioned that one problem with cmacros is that if
you redefine a function, the cmacro property stays around and thus the
redefinition of the function isn't communicate to the compiler.
  He suggested that whenever a function is defined (via 'def' or when fasl'ed
in) any cmacro properties should be remprop'ed.   I've been trying to think
of an alternative to this, but I can't think of one.  Unless someone
has a better idea, I'll implement his suggestion.
  This means that if you want to define the function 'foo' and a cmacro for
'foo', the cmacro definition must appear later in the file than 'foo's
definition.

  I've got a copy of a paper by Richard Waters (at mit) describing a system
for writing loops in lisp (and other languages).  Basically you describe the
loop in functional programming terms (similar to Backus's FP, or apl) and
the LetS package converts it into an iterative form for efficient execution
in lisp.
  We don't have the LetS code here to play with, and we probably won't be
able to get it for a while since our arpanet connection is hopelessly
clogged for anything but tiny messages.   However you might be interested in
stopping by my office and looking at the paper.

  I could make it a 'Note'.  I would prefer not to make it a warning because
such redefinition is guaranteed to occur when the compiler compiles itself
and the lisp code part of the lisp system.

1.  Welcome!

     It seems  about time to publish  the  second  of  these

items.  We would also like to relay to others such  informa-
tion as has been forwarded to us. The reports of projects at
Berkeley (and elsewhere) may strike sympathetic chords  with
other research.

2.  New programs

2.1.  OPS-5

     OPS-5 is a "production system" written by Charles Forgy
of  CMU.   It  appears to work just fine in Franz, and is in
wide use.  Interested persons may obtain copies of  documen-
tation and the program from Charles.Forgy@CMU-10A. ( Charles

sity, Pittsburgh, PA  15213)

It is their policy to send it to anyone who wants it free of
charge.

2.2.  GLISP

     GLISP is a system which provides interesting linguistic
features for generic operations and data abstraction.  Writ-
ten by Gordon Novak at Stanford University,  it  was  origi-
nally  developed for Interlisp, but has been ported to other
lisps, including Franz.

2.3.  Flavors

     There are now two distinct implementations,  apparently
with  identical  functionally,  of "flavors" as appearing in
the MIT Lisp Machine software.  One is described in TR-1174,

"Franz Flavors" by Richard J. Wood (Dept of C.S.,  Univ.  of
Maryland,  College  Pk, MD 20742).  The other was written by
Juan R. Loaiza of MIT, Laboratory for Computer Science.   We
have  a  copy  of  the  latter  on-line  here, and expect to
receive a copy of the Maryland one,  shortly.   Eric  Cooper
here at Berkeley is in charge of the flavors situation.

     There is an implementation of closures, mostly compati-
ble  with  the Lisp Machine specification, announced by John
Foderaro for Opus 38.33. The incompatibility is a result  of
what  we  perceive to be a high performance penalty for eso-
terica.

2.4.  Database Interfaces

     Jim Larus at UCB has cooked up interfaces to  both  the
INGRES  relational  database  system,  and the simpler TROLL
database system.  These will be described in his forthcoming
MS report, along with the next item.

2.5.  Cursor-control and Menus

     Larus has provided an implementation of screen  manage-
ment which uses the UNIX "curses" package for primitive win-
dow  management.   A  menu-based  interface  has  also  been
developed as part of this.

2.6.  Vaxima and Algebraic Manipulation

     A new version of vaxima, the VAX version of the MACSYMA
algebraic  manipulation system, was released in July by UCB,
incorporating some bug fixes, improved programs, and a large
number  of  user-contributed subroutine libraries.  This was
made available to test-site licensees.   Unfortunately,  MIT
has  suspended  new  test-site  licensing since about April,
1982.  We hope that MIT will be liberalizing  its  distribu-
tion policy to non-commercial sites.

     See the note below about MACSYMA being sold.

     As a counterpoint to this, UC Berkeley has  received  a
substantial grant from the System Development Foundation for
work on Mathematical Representation and Manipulation,  which
should  result in some more advanced systems for application
of  computers  to  symbolic  mathematics.   Recruiting   for
researchers,  staff,  and  students  is  underway  now,  and
interested persons should contact Richard Fateman.

2.7.  VLSI Design Rule Checker

     Lyra, written in Lisp by Michael Arnold, is a retarget-
able,  hierarchical,  design rule checker for VLSI circuits.
Lyra features a rule  compiler  (also  written  in  Lisp  of













course!)  which translates symbolic design rule descriptions
to lisp code for checking the rules.  Lyra was used for  the
RISC  project.  It  is  currently  being used extensively at
Berkeley, and will be included in the  Fall-82  distribution
of  of the Berkeley CAD tools.  For more information contact
Michael Arnold or John Ousterhout at Berkeley.

2.8.  Generic Arithmetic

     As a proposed extension to  Franz  arithmetic,  Richard
Fateman,  Keith  Sklower  and Scott Morrison, have written a
simple-minded  generic  arithmetic  package  which  includes
modules which can be loaded to support exact rational arith-
metic, software-simulated IEEE  extended  arithmetic,  arbi-
trary  precision floating point, complex, interval, and mul-
tivariate polynomial. Combinations of some of these are sup-
ported,  although  the  package is as yet incomplete in some
areas.  The IEEE arithmetic  simulation  is  written  in  C.
These  packages  are  probably  not in good enough shape for
casual use by others.


3.  New features

     Various performance enhancements  and  bug  fixes  have
been  incorporated  in  versions of Franz (now on Opus 38.33
and the compiler, Liszt 8.14) These are mentioned  in  brief
here;  more  details  accompany  updates  of  the system and
manual included in the forthcoming Berkeley 4.2BSD UNIX dis-
tribution.

3.1.  Franz

     We added a switch to cause the evaluator to save  macro
expansions so they need only be expanded once.

     We added vector and vector-immediate data types.

     We rewrote showstack and backtrace so they  are  easier
to use.

     We made the lisp to  foreign  function  interface  more
secure.  The system now allows foreign function to call lisp
functions.

     We added closures and support  flavors,  features  from
the Lisp Machine.

3.2.  Liszt

     Liszt will check the  number  of  arguments  to  system
functions and user defined functions.
9

9










     Liszt supports local declarations.

     Liszt will  automatically  compile  lambda  expressions
headed by the function `function'.

     Liszt supports compiler-only macros and  will  autoload
macros if necessary.

4.  MC68000

     Keith Sklower and Kevin Layer have been working on  the
MC68000  version  of  Franz  under the UNIX operating system
(using a DUAL System 83). While the current configuration is
a  swapping  system, the Lisp should be able to use the full
address space of the CPU. We expect to have this system run-
ning  on the UNIX 4.2 BSD SUN software, too. The base system
on the DUAL, including  the  interpreter,  reader,  bignums,
fasl, works; the compiler is being perfected.


5.  Other Lisps

     We now have, in-house tried 4  (other)  VAX  UNIX  lisp
systems:  YLISP,  Interlisp,  PSL,  and VLISP.  We know that
Interlisp can run also on  VMS  using  the  Eunice  package.
Interested parties can contact David Dyer at USC-ISI.  There
is also a version of lisp which runs  on  VMS  only,  namely
NIL,  from  MIT, which appears to be undergoing limited dis-
tribution.  Two other lisps under development under UNIX are
Yale's  answer to NIL, namely "T", and Common Lisp, from CMU
and friends.

     Counting Franz, that makes  7 lisp systems for the  VAX
computer line. Not counting variants on 2 operating systems.
A Paen to standardization.

     Dick Gabriel states some  useful  principles  for  com-
parisons  in  the conference record of the 1982 ACM Lisp and
Functional Programming Conference, which was held in August.
We  understand  he  now has a collection of some 18 programs
which he is continuing to time on various systems.

6.  Work in Progress

6.1.  BITGRAPH SUN AED-512

     Greg Foster at UCB is working on  raster-graphics  sup-
port in Franz for the 800 by 1000 b/w raster displays of the
BBN Bitgraph and/or the SUN Workstation,  and  possibly  the
color  512 by 512 AED system.  We are probably going to han-
dle mice and Bitpad (stylus) input for pointing.  There  are
lots  of  projects  we hear about with similar systems, e.g.
just recently from the University of  Maryland,  using  UNIX













and multiplexed files for window management of a 68000-based
home-grown workstation.

6.2.  RISC-LISP

     Yes, Reduced Instruction Set Computer  fans,  who  else
but  UCB  would  be  so bold... Carl Ponder is examining the
issues involved in constructing a fast lisp interpreter  and
compiler  for  the  RISC architecture.  You see, we have all
these chips...


7.  Work Contemplated

7.1.  Fast Number Compiler

     Undergraduate Jeff Cohen at  Berkeley  is  starting  to
look  at  this.   There are several industrial concerns that
have expressed interest in using such a system, but expected
it to be subsidized by someone else.

7.2.  IBM Franz

     Even more nibbles on this one, but not yet.

8.  Business News

8.1.  Eunice SOLD

     Some of you may have heard  that  the  Eunice  software
package was sold by SRI to the Wollongong Group, a UNIX sup-
port group in Palo Alto.   Prices  range  from  $2k  (educa-
tional)  to  $5k (commercial).  Naturally this package is of
interest beyond the availability of Franz Lisp.  We have not
compared  this  product  to  other similar ones, but we know
that TWG has been distributing a working Franz opus 38.

     As far as alternatives to Eunice, we  are  aware  of  a
system  developed  at  Rice University, and another by Human
Computing  Resources  (HCR)  in  Toronto.    We   have   not
evaluated either of these.

8.2.  MACSYMA SOLD

     MIT has sold exclusive rights to MACSYMA, a large alge-
braic  manipulation  system, to Symbolics, Inc. of Cambridge
Mass. This package runs in Franz Lisp, (among  other  Lisps)
We  hope that soon it will again be available to educational
institutions with VAX systems either from us  or  Symbolics,
at a nominal charge.  We understand that commercial licenses
(from Symbolics) for versions of MACSYMA  on  PDP-10s,  Lisp
Machines,  etc.   will distributed at non-nominal prices and
offered with maintenance contracts.

	Can someone give me a pointer to the Franz flavor system
	developed by U. Maryland?  I am looking for information on how to
	FTP the files -- what machine, whether public, what files, etc.

Since the U. of Maryland is not (yet) an Arpanet host, you can't
FTP files directly from here.  We are right now completing some
documentation for all of our hacks -- including documentation for
some recent improvements for our flavors system.  When that
documentation is complete, we will be ready to distribute the
packages developed here.  Besides flavors, this includes a top
level called userexec which is based on INTERLISP's top level and
a production system called YAPS similar to but more flexible than
OPS5.

We are supposed to become an Arpanet host in a few months...  (Read
open ended period of time.)  Meanwhile, if you would like to get
our code, mail me a tape, and I will mail it back with the code and
documentation on it.  I'd appreciate it if someone would volunteer
to let other folks FTP the files from their machine until we do
become an Arpanet host.  My address is:

Subject: (random) problems
Status: RO

I am having two problems using (random) in Franz lisp.  The first problem is
that I can't find any way to set the seed.  Every time I enter lisp, the
generator is in the same state.  I have had to resort to cfasling a c
procedure that calls srand() (as (random) seems to be defined in c by a call
on rand()).  Is there a way to do this within lisp?  The other problem is
more serious.  The generator seems to generate tight cycles for (at least)
arguments that are small powers of 2.  For example, repeatedly executing
(random 2) yields the sequence 01010101..., and (random 4) yields
01230123....  These sequences apparently occur no matter to what value I set
the seed.  Does anyone one know what I could be doing wrong, or have a
working random number generator?

To the person who asked about random number generators and deficiencies
in (random) [I can't write mail to you for some reason]:

You're not doing anything wrong; that's the way the sucker works.
One good way to get random numbers is to do the syscall that gets
you the number of seconds since whenever-it-is, and use the mod
function. This is especially good for getting a random one or zero,
by using the evenp function.

  It can't do symbolic links (I've only been adding system calls that I had
a use for).

  setf is a generalized setq.  The target can be an expression which locates
a value.  setf figures out how to store in the target.
for example:

  (setf x 3)        ==  (setq x 3)
  (setf (car x) 3)  == (rplaca x 3)
  (setf (get foo 'bar) 3) == (putprop foo 3 'bar)

the target must be something it has been 'taught' to understand, or it can
be a macro, in which case setf macro-expands it and takes another look.

The setf macro (and a list of targets it knows about is in
/usr/lib/lisp/common2.l)

Subject: Random Numbers in Franz
To: alice!ucbvax!franz-friends

In general, it is very bad practice to compute a random number between 0
and n by any expression such as (mod (random) n).  In fact, Franz's
random function does exactly that, returning the number generated by the
C function rand(3) modulo n.  This technique uses only the rightmost 
bits of successive calls to rand, and the righmost n bits of congruential
sequences (like that returned by rand(3)) have a period of AT MOST 2**n
(See Knuth vol.2 p. 12).  So using the rightmost two bits will indeed give
you sequences of at most period 4.  (If your lisp doesn't have this 
behavior, you're not using the standard rand.)

A better way to do it is to use the high order bits, by dividing the entire
range up into n pieces and then seeing where you fall.  (This method is
biased if n is of the same order as the range, though.)

The code I use is:


(or (getd '$old-random) (putd '$old-random (getd 'random)))

(defun random n
  (cond ((eq n 0) ($old-random))
	((fix (quotient (boole 1 ($old-random) #o 7777777777)
			(quotient #o 7777777777 (arg 1)))))))

	Franz Lisp Distribution
	
  This note describes our distribution policy for Franz Lisp.

What is being distributed:
  We distribute only source code in order to keep the distribution
  small and relatively Unix independent.   Makefiles are provided to
  build the entire lisp system from source, even if you don't have
  a version of lisp running already.  This process takes about 3 cpu
  hours on a Vax 780.  [This version for the Vax only, a 68000 version
  is being worked on.  Contact ucbkim.sklower@berkeley or 
  ucbkim.layer@berkeley]

  The following source is provided:
    lisp interpreter, 
    compiler (liszt),
    cross reference program (lxref),
    lisp manual,
    and other utility programs:
       trace, step, debug, cmu library functions, (and other minor ones),
       and these packages from the MIT lisp library:
	    defstruct, loop, flavors. 
   	    [These programs are provided as a convenience to those who can't
	     access the arpanet and copy them.  There is no documentation for
	     them in the Franz Lisp manual.  The best source of documentation
	     is the Lisp Machine manual (available from MIT, Symbolics
	     or LMI)]

   Regarding Flavors:  there are two implementations of flavors for
	Franz Lisp, one from MIT (contact person Richard Zippel (rz@mit-mc))
	and one from the University of Maryland (contact person
	Liz Allen  (liz.umcp-cs@udel-relay)).  Neither implementation is
	exactly like flavors on the Lisp Machine (due to differences between
	Lisp Machine lisp and Franz Lisp), and the implementations differ
	from each other.    We incorporated the Mit version into the
	standard distribution because the high bandwidth between here and
	MIT will insure that it keeps up to date with the current Franz.
	This is not to imply that it is the better implementation.
	We haven't had enough experience with flavors to judge.
	Those seriously interested in Flavors should contact Liz
	Allen and ask for the Tech Report on the Univ Of Maryland Flavors
	system.

What is the form of the distribution:
  The files are packaged in a giant (2.1Mbyte) shell script.  Running this
shell script through 'sh' will result in a directory tree.  A ReadMe file
in the current directory will contain instructions on building the lisp
system.  The shell script is broken into a number of smaller files.
The current distribution looks like:
% ls
total 2092
 195 opus38.40.aa	 195 opus38.40.ae	 195 opus38.40.ai
 195 opus38.40.ab	 195 opus38.40.af	 195 opus38.40.aj
 195 opus38.40.ac	 195 opus38.40.ag	 142 opus38.40.ak
 195 opus38.40.ad	 195 opus38.40.ah

The '38.40' means Opus 38, minor version 40.  These numbers may be different
by the time you get your distribution.  In order to extract the lisp
files from this shell script, you need only type:
	cat * | sh


To get a copy of the distribution:
  The distribution may be obtained either using FTP from an arpanet site,
or on a magnetic tape through the U.S Mail.

 Arpanet:
   The files are stored on the ucb-c70 (NCP) arpanet host in the
   directory /users/lisp/lispuser.  If you have an account on the ucb-c70,
   you are free to take FTP a copy of these files.
   If you do not have an account on the ucb-c70, send me (jkf@berkeley) a
   message and I will set up a temporary account for you.
   If you are on a TCP host, write me and we will set up an account on one
   of our Vax's for you to FTP the files.  Eventually we will have an
   anonymous login on a TCP machine.

 Mag Tape:
   In order to get a copy of the distribution mailed to you, send a check to
 cover our tape copying and mailing costs (fees are listed below).  We will
 purchase the mag tape and you are free to keep it.  Please do NOT
 send us a tape.

     Fees:
     		$50	- distribution tape mailed 3rd class
	    add $10	- a copy of the Lisp Manual (we will only
	       		  send one copy, you are free to photocopy it)
  	    add $7	- send tape via 1st class mail.

	     -or-
	     	$15	- for just a copy of the Lisp Manual

 The address to send checks to is 

	Keith Sklower
	EECS/Computer Science Division
	524 Evans Hall
	University of California
	Berkeley, CA  94720

 All checks should be made out to "Regents, University of California."
 We require pre-payment.  We will not invoice or process purchase orders.



Disclaimers:
    This distribution works on the latest versions of Unix running at
    Berkeley (4.1a).  We can't guarantee that it will work on older
    versions (although, if you are running 4.1, it is almost certain
    that it will work, but we have not verified it).
    VMS users who are using a typical Unix compatibility package will

  The function 'retrace' will insure that all functions which should be
traced are indeed traced.   This will solve the problem of reloading
a file whose functions are traced.  After you load a file, you can
type (retrace) and those functions which became untraced during the loading
process, will be traced again.

  The top-level-print and top-level-read variables will now take effect
within a trace break.

   It is easy to make #! do a zapline.   If you have a recent version of
lisp, just execute:

(defsharp ! (x) (zapline))

(this could be put in your .lisprc, if you don't want to affect other 
people).    The problem with adding this to Franz by default is that the
sharpsign macro is shared by a number of lisps and few of them run under
Unix.   Therefore, few other lisps are going to want #! to be zapline.


  Regarding the -f switch:  The -f switch is used to communicate between the
bootstrap at the beginning of a fasl file and the lisp interpreter.  It
wasn't meant as a general 'fasl this file' switch for users to make use of.
The choice of '-f' was bad, it should have been something more unique like
'-- autorun' so that a user would be unlikely to type it.   We have avoided
assigning meanings to switches on lisp's command line because we want to give
each user the opportunity to assign whatever meaning he wants to whatever
switch he wants.   It isn't difficult to write a program to scan the command
line.

Re:
    The (setq searchlist (cvtsearchpathtolist (getenv 'PATH))) would not be
    necessary, because the exec syscall supplies the full path name, because
    the shell has already done the path searching on the command name.  The
    only place that might have to be searched is the current directory.

This isn't true.  (argv 0) is the command that you typed, not the full path
name to the command.  Only by prepending all the directories in the
search list can you find the location of the command.

  The setf macro will now handle all car and cdr forms (i.e. c{ad}+r).
  Thanks to peter norvig for this.

  There is a new macro called 'defvar'.  It is used to declare special
variables and optionally to give them an initial value.  It is used
at top level in a file (outside of defuns).

forms:
(defvar foo)	; declares foo to be special
(defvar bar 3)	; declares bar to be special and when this file is read in
		; bar will be given the value 3 if it is unbound.
An advantage of '(defvar foo)' over '(declare (special foo))' is that if
a file containing defvars is loaded (or fasl'ed) in during compilation,
the variables mentioned in the defvar's will be declared special.  The only
way to have that effect with '(declare (special foo))' is to 'include'
the file.  

 There is a new macro, 'environment', which can be used at the beginning of
a file to specify what sort of environment this file needs in order to be
compiled or run.  For example:
(environment (compile eval) (files mymacros othermacros)
	     (compile) (syntax maclisp))

says that when compiling or loading into the interpreter, the files
mymacros and othermacros should be loaded (if they aren't loaded already).
When compiling, the maclisp syntax should be used.
The general form of 'environment' is:
   (environment when1 what1
   	        when2 what2
		...    ...
		whenN whatN)
the when's are a subset of (eval compile load), and the symbols have the
same meaning as they do in 'eval-when'.
The what's are either
	(files file1 file2 ... fileN)
		insure that the named files are loaded.  To see if fileX
		is loaded, it looks for a 'version' property under
		fileX's property list.  Thus to prevent multiple loading,
		you should put
		(putprop 'myfile t 'version) at the end of myfile.l
	(syntax type)
		type is either maclisp, intlisp, ucilisp, franzlisp
		This sets the syntax correctly.

There are additional macros to set of standard environments:
(environment-maclisp)  sets up the maclisp environment.  This is what
	you would get by using the -m switch to liszt.

(environment-lmlisp)  sets up the lisp machine environment. This is like
	maclisp but it has additional macros.

	
It is possible to add when's and what's to the specialized environments,
e.g.
 (environment-maclisp (compile eval) (files foo bar))

Shouldn't defvar take any number of arguments, like setq?  As it is,

I suspect the extra arguments to defvar are used in other systems for
storage of documentation strings in appropriate places.  E.g.
(defvar dozen 12 "initially 12 except in the baker system when it is 13")
causes some association with defvar and documentation should be put on
a file.

 fateman is correct that there is an optional third argument for
documentation.   We don't want to add multiple arguments because defvar
it will mean that code we write here can't be transported to
other lisp which only expect one defvar argument.

  This is a long message so I'll put the most important thing first, in case
you choose not to read the rest of the message:
  *** object files generated by liszt 8.19 will not run in any lisp
  *** older than 38.48.    Object files which were generated by
  *** liszt's before 8.19 will continue to work in the new lisp.


There were two major changes to lisp and liszt:
 1) compiled functions will test at runtime to make sure that they
    are passed the correct number of arguments.

 2) the lambda list keywords &optional, &rest and &aux are open compiled
    in an efficient manner.

I'll refresh your memory on what the possible forms are for the & keywords:

  the formal parameter list of a def has this form
  ( required-args
    [ &optional optional-arguments ]
    [ &rest rest-argument ]
    [ &aux  aux-arguments ])

 as in this example which shows all possible forms:

 (def foo 
   (lambda (a b &optional c (d 23 d-p) (dd (bar)) &rest e &aux (f 12) g)
    	(compute)))

   
 the meaning and forms of the various parts of the formal parameter list are:

 required-args: a sequence of n (zero or more) symbols which will be bound
 	to the first n actual arguments.

 optional-args:	a sequence of m (zero or more) symbols which will be
 	bound to the next m actual arguments if they are present, or
	to default values.
	the forms of an optional argument are:
	
	foo	- bind foo to the argument if it present, otherwise bind it
		  to nil
	(foo (expr)) - bind foo to the argument if it is present, otherwise
		evaluate (expr) and bind foo to the result.

	(foo (expr) foo-p)  - bind foo to the argument if it is present, 
		otherwise evaluate (expr) and bind foo to the result.
		Also, bind foo-p to t if the argument is present, otherwise
		bind foo-p to nil.  foo-p will be treated like an &aux
		variable (see below) but it should NOT be declared in the
		&aux list!

  rest-arg : a single symbol which will be bound to a list of the rest of the
  	arguments.  This list is cons'ed up each time the function is called.

  aux-args : these args are just like arguments to let or prog within the
  	function body so this & keyword isn't really necessary (but there
	are few things in lisp that really are necessary).

	the forms of the aux arg are:

	foo - bind foo to nil
	(foo (expr))  - evaluate (expr) and bind foo to the result.



The compiler understands the &keywords but the interpreter does not.  'def'
will convert a form with &keywords to a lexpr which is almost equivalent.
The differences are:
    The interpreted form, being a lexpr, is allowed to use the 'arg'
	function.  The compiled form, even with optional args,
	is not a lexpr and thus 'arg' is illegal.

    The order that &aux variables are lambda bound is slightly different
        between interpreted and compiled code.  As long as default
	expressions reference no formal parameters after them in the
	formal parameter list, there should be no problems.

    The interpreted version will not check for the correct number of
        arguments.

Local functions cannot have &keywords.	

If you have any questions on this, send me mail.  This change should
only break functions which expect a variable number of argument and
which don't declare the fact using &optional programs.  There may be,
of course, implementation errors.  If you notice anything unusual
please let me know right away.  The old compiler will be
in /usr/ucb/oliszt for a while.

    There are now three new command line features for liszt:

    1. -E <s-expr>, where <s-expr> will be evaluated before compilation
       starts.  For example, the setting of constants can be done in this way:

	   liszt -E '(setq foobar "***foobar-string***")' foobar.l

       and in the file being compiled, foobar is accessed as '#.foobar.

    2. -I <include-file>, where <include-file> will be loaded (via load)
       before compilation starts.

    3. A combination of the -S and -o switches will set the .s file, as in:

        liszt -S -o foo.vax.s foo.l

      where previously, the -S determined the name of the .s file (foo.s in
      the above example).

We have a simple interface from Franz to Emacs, but I much prefer to go the
other way, i.e. run Franz as a inferior job under Emacs.  I believe there
are several Emacs packages which allow one to run inferior jobs in an Emacs
window (I have my own which is, unfortunately totally undocumented). Some of
the benefits of this set up include:

    - one has all of the text editing functions available in Emacs
    - one has many lisp-based editing functions available in Emacs
      (thru mock-lisp packages like electriclisp)
    - one has a history of the session in the editing buffer
    - one has an environment which supports multiple concurrent
      processes running in seperate windows.
    - it is very easy to experiment with new interface features such as
      symbol completion and re-evaluation of previously issued commands

What is the distribution policy?

I work for a company that has opus 36 and is now currently running opus 37.
Here at the University of Utah we are running opus 38.04. Is it OK to
make a tape of the University's 38.04 to bring my company more up to
date? Do I have to make it more formal by signing a transfer agreement
or by obtaining the release directly from Berkeley?

                              Thanks in advance,
                                 Harold Carr

  Here is our current distribution policy.  This differs a bit from
the one sent out a month ago [in particular, we now have anonymous ftp]

				    -[Fri Jan 28 08:31:45 1983 by jkf]-
	Franz Lisp Distribution
	
  This note describes our distribution policy for Franz Lisp.

What is being distributed:
  We distribute only source code in order to keep the distribution
  small and relatively Unix independent.   Makefiles are provided to
  build the entire lisp system from source, even if you don't have
  a version of lisp running already.  This process takes about 3 cpu
  hours on a Vax 780.  [This version for the Vax only, a 68000 version
  is being worked on.  Contact ucbkim.sklower@berkeley or 
  ucbkim.layer@berkeley]

  The following source is provided:
    lisp interpreter, 
    compiler (liszt),
    cross reference program (lxref),
    lisp manual,
    and other utility programs:
       trace, step, debug, cmu library functions, (and other minor ones),
       and these packages from the MIT lisp library:
	    defstruct, loop. 
   	    [These programs are provided as a convenience to those who can't
	     access the arpanet and copy them.  There is no documentation for
	     them in the Franz Lisp manual.  The best source of documentation
	     is the Lisp Machine manual (available from MIT, Symbolics
	     or LMI)]

   Regarding Flavors:  there are two implementations of flavors for
	Franz Lisp, one from MIT (contact person Richard Zippel (rz@mit-mc))
	and one from the University of Maryland (contact person
	Liz Allen  (liz.umcp-cs@udel-relay)).  Neither implementation is
	exactly like flavors on the Lisp Machine (due to differences between
	Lisp Machine lisp and Franz Lisp), and the implementations differ
	from each other.    The MIT version cannot be distributed by 
	us (yet) due to licensing problems.   If you have a Lisp Machine
	Source license from Symbolics, you should be able to get a copy
	from MIT.
	For a Tech Report on Maryland flavors, write to Liz Allen.

What is the form of the distribution:
  The files are packaged in a giant (2.1Mbyte) shell script.  Running this
shell script through 'sh' will result in a directory tree.  A ReadMe file
in the current directory will contain instructions on building the lisp
system.  The shell script is broken into a number of smaller files.
The current distribution looks like:

total 2089
 489 -rw-r--r--  1 jkf        500003 Jan 26 11:33 opus38.50.aa
 489 -rw-r--r--  1 jkf        500002 Jan 26 11:35 opus38.50.ab
 489 -rw-r--r--  1 jkf        500047 Jan 26 11:37 opus38.50.ac
 489 -rw-r--r--  1 jkf        500007 Jan 26 11:38 opus38.50.ad
 133 -rw-r--r--  1 jkf        136038 Jan 26 11:39 opus38.50.ae

The '38.50' means Opus 38, minor version 50.  These numbers may be different
by the time you get your distribution.  In order to extract the lisp
files from this shell script, you need only type:
	cat * | sh


To get a copy of the distribution:
  The distribution may be obtained either using FTP from an arpanet site,
or on a magnetic tape through the U.S Mail.

 Arpanet:
   The files are stored on the arpanet host 'ucb-vax' [ if you have an out
   of date host table, it may be called 'ucb-monet' or 'ucb-ingres'. Its
   internet number is 10.2.0.78].
   You can login as 'anonymous'.   Use your name as the password.
   The files are in the subdirectory pub/lisp.
   
   For those who have accounts on ucb-vax, the full path is ~ftp/pub/lisp.

 Mag Tape:
   In order to get a copy of the distribution mailed to you, send a check to
 cover our tape copying and mailing costs (fees are listed below).  We will
 purchase the mag tape and you are free to keep it.  Please do NOT
 send us a tape.

     Fees:
     		$50	- distribution tape mailed 3rd class
	    add $10	- a copy of the Lisp Manual (we will only
	       		  send one copy, you are free to photocopy it)
  	    add $7	- send tape via 1st class mail.

	     -or-
	     	$15	- for just a copy of the Lisp Manual

 The address to send checks to is 

	Keith Sklower
	EECS/Computer Science Division
	524 Evans Hall
	University of California
	Berkeley, CA  94720

 All checks should be made out to "Regents, University of California."
 We require pre-payment.  We will not invoice or process purchase orders.



Disclaimers:
    This distribution works on the latest versions of Unix running at
    Berkeley (4.1a).  We can't guarantee that it will work on older
    versions (although, if you are running 4.1, it is almost certain
    that it will work, but we have not verified it).
    VMS users who are using a typical Unix compatibility package will 
    probably not be able to build a lisp from this distribution unless they
    know a great deal about VMS and their compatibility package.
    At least one package (Eunice) supports Franz at this time.
    
Redistribution:
    If you get a copy of the distribution, you are free to give it to
    other people.  We appreciate being informed of new sites so they
    can be put on a mailing list (electronic and conventional).  This
    list is used to announce new releases.  To be put on this list,
    send U.S. Mail to Keith Sklower (address above) or to 
    franz-friends-request@berkeley or ucbvax!franz-friends-request

  I'm sorry for the multiple messages.  The franz-friends mailing list is
huge and the machine which does the mailing is crashing often.  Our local
mail wizard informs me that if it crashes while in the middle of sending
mail it will not have a record of who it sent to before the crash.
  I hope you don't get too many copies of this message.

I'm sure you've probably received several messages similar to this one,
but just in case...

There exists the capability in Unix Emacs to run a process in its own
buffer.  Typein can be directed to the process, and output is just sent
right to the buffer.  This is an excellent way of running Lisp, because 
you get all of the nice Emacs features (paren balancing, local sexpr
editing) at essentially no cost.  I have been largely unsuccessful with
trying to run Emacs under Lisp.

The process package is part of the standard Unix Emacs distribution.

We have been running our PSL (Portable Standard Lisp) in gemacs
(Gosling's emacs) windows for some time.  I suspect it would be a minor
hack to convert it to Franz, but haven't done it and am not a Franz
user.  I could mail you our .ml code if you wanted to undertake
converting it to Franz (or just using it for inspiration and hacking
your own) and distributing it to Franz folks.

It works like this:  The lisp process is associated with a gemacs
buffer/window.  In that window you can carry on a normal line-by-line
conversation, if you wish.  <CR> sends the current line, (back to mark,
which is left after the prompt) into the lisp.  We mostly use the PSL
in Rlisp syntax, which is algol-like, but this part of the code is just
a wrapping for the new-shell function in process.ml with appropriate
editting syntax set, so you could do the same with no work for any
Lisp.

You can send an expression, fn def, etc. from any other lisp-mode
window with a single keypress.  Echoing as input in the dialog window
is inhibited if a prefix arg is provided, so you don't have to look at
long exprs or fn defs again, just the lisp response.  

Sending multiple line exprs in response to a single prompt depends on
the fact that PSL numbers the prompts for history, like the c-shell.  A
gemacs mlisp output filter process monitors the output for toploop
prompts and feeds another line of input if the same prompt number comes
back, instead of printing the prompt.

The result is pretty classy.  You get the full many-window gemacs
editing environment with tags, etc. for random-access navigation and
just send chunks of code as you change them.  The extreme of usage is
"menu" like windows which contain debugging code in clusters rather
than sequences.  You select exprs with the cursor and send them in any
order.

We also provide key fns for the common case of sending single lines to
the toploop or single-character commands to the break-loop without
editting them into a buffer.

Best respond directly to me, since I am not on Franz-Friends.

We have a few franz<->emacs interfaces, but I'm not sure what you mean.
One is the process.ml package that comes with gosling's emacs (the emacs
that I assume you are talking about).  With this package, you can run
franz inside a window from within emacs and have the facilities of an
editor along with lisp.  The other thing we have is a local Franz
package called the load1 package.  This package was written for
compiling flavors (like in the lisp machine; another local package)
and has a function called vi.  (vi 'lisp-function) will call the
editor (from the environment variable VISUAL, /usr/ucb/vi is default) on the
file which contains the definition of the lisp function, positioning
the editor at the point in the file where the function is defined.  Upon
exiting the editor, it asks you if you want to reload the modified file.
To edit a function from a file this way, the file must have been load1'ed
previously so that the info on where the function is stored and what type
it is will have been saved.  Load1 will distinguish between different
types of functions, ie. defflavors, defmethods, defmacros, defuns etc.
and will search for the correct definition in the file.  Is this what
you mean?  If you like I can send you the four or five files necessary.

I don't seem to be able to write Jed Krohnfeldt, and this
answer is probably of general interest anyway. The message
"ld: no namelist" means that some well-meaning system admin
has stripped the lisp executable file to save space;
unfortunately, this makes the dynamic loading used by cfasl
impossible. Lisp will have to be recompiled (groan). No Franz
Lisp executable file should EVER be stripped.

Can someone tell me how the maximum amount of storage that franz
lisp uses is decided? I can force the size up to (about) 3050
pages (according to "ps") and then get the message "storage exhausted".
I have been told (and have seen) other jobs get substantially more
space; can franz get more pages as well? (I am using the cshell
and have already used the limit command to raise my process
size up to 32 megabytes, or so I think.)
 
I have also been told that the garbage collector leaks, that is,
not all of the garbage is really collected. Does anyone have good
ideas about how much (or fast) this happens, or if there is some way
to minimize the lost space?

Does the Liszt compiler have any notion of global variables --
free variables with fast access, without any rebinding?

I think the MACLISP compiler has something like this for variables
beginning "**".

  I don't understand the distinction between what you call a global variable
and a special variable.   A special variable in Franz Lisp (and any other
shallow bound lisp) can be accessed rapidly and is only rebound if you
put it in a lambda, prog or do variable list.

  liszt will now pass the assembler the -V switch.  This tells the assembler
to keep its intermediate file in core rather than putting it in /tmp.
This should make assembly slightly faster and also permit large lisp files to
be compiled on systems with small /tmp's.

This doesn't seem to work. I'm using Liszt version 8.10, University

is sketchy, but it seems that compiling and loading the file:

(setq appsum (function (lambda (x) (apply 'sum x))))

should leave a bcd object in appsum's value, but it doesn't. It
leaves the uncompiled lambda. Am I doing something wrong?

   Liszt only compiles functions, not literals it finds in files.
To make this statement be compiled:
(setq appsum (function (lambda (x) (apply 'sum x))))

you should surround it with a function defintion:
(defun junk ()
	(setq appsum (function (lambda (x) (apply 'sum x)))))

Harold,

A couple of things make it seem unlikely that anyone would have such a
package right now.  First, we don't even have a final Common Lisp manual
yet -- Guy's next draft is due very soon, but there will be some tuning
and hassling after that.  Second, there are things in Common Lisp that
would be very tough to fake on Franz: lexical binding, generic
sequences, some of the hairy number types, character objects, etc.
Common Lisp is pretty close to being a superset of Franz, so I would
expect to see Franz compatibility packages in Common Lisp, but not vice
versa.  Third, if anyone were writing such a package, they would be
crazy not to have arranged for access to our code that implements all of
the hairy functions, and nobody has done this to my knowledge.

My standard advice is for people to continue to code in Franz with the
knowledge that they can easily convert their code to Common Lisp
whenever the DEC Common Lisp is available to them.  This should be a
one-time conversion, since moving the other way after "going native" in
Common Lisp would be very tough.

If someone does pop up with a compatibility package -- even a partial
one -- I would be interested in hearing about it.

I think that a common-lisp-compatibility package written
in Franz would not be as difficult as all that. 

If Common Lisp (TM of DEC?) were available on all the same
machines at the same price, (appx. $0.) and CL were
in fact a superset of Franz for all practical purposes, and
with similar or better efficiency, etc. Why would anyone bother?

Of course if CL does not meet all of the objectives (e.g. price, machines),
then a CL-to-Franz "translator" might make sense.

With that in mind,
I would like to officially request a copy of the Common Lisp
language (as implemented in CL, presumably), as soon as it
becomes available (i.e. no later than when it is a "product"
of DEC, and probably at "beta" test time).
I agree fully with Scott that trying to do this with an incomplete
language specification is unwise.

I am also not making any commitment to do anything with CL at
Berkeley, but since we are building tools for our own applications,
and CL might be useful, we might consider an efficient merge of
ideas.

 of mail errors from our local mailer.   The problem is not that we have a
 lot of illegal addresses, but that over the three day period that the

 Thanks to some suggestions from rms we are now one step closer to
full closures.   fclosures will now work if called recursively.
It is still true that the only way to make fclosures share variables
is to use fclosure-list.

 symeval-in-fclosure may return the wrong value if the closure is 
'active'.  This will be fixed eventually.

When we attempted to cfasl a file that used the curses package
of screen control routines into Franz 38.40, we got the message
_ospeed: /usr/libcurses.a (cr_tty.o) multiply defined.
The apparent cause of this cryptic remark is that in lam9.c
there is an extern variable ospeed. There are a number of
tantalizing routines in this source file dealing with termcaps that
are apparently not called by anyone. Are there plans for these
routines? Does anyone use them (heaven forbid they should be
documented!). Our current fix is to just change ospeed to ospiid
which so far has had no dire effects, but I am interested in others
experience. The curses stuff seems to work fine after this
modification.

  Our group at NRL is planning to purchase Sun workstations. I
currently have a substantial amount of code written in Franz Lisp that
I want to run on the Sun. 
 
  What is the status of the Berkeley group porting Franz to the Sun?   
How do I get a copy?

  Also, I have a few concerns about configuring a Sun to run Franz well.  
The basic desktop Sun workstation provides 1 Mbyte of physical memory.   
This can be extended to 2 Mbyte or one can add an Ethernet interface
*but not both*.  Since I am unwilling to give up my Ethernet
interface I may be forced to run Franz in 1 Mbyte and contend with
the added paging overhead (using a 68010 running 4.2bsd and a local disk).

  Has anyone out there had experience running Franz Lisp on a Sun in
such a configuration?  Can I get away without the 2 Mbyte extension?
I think your answers would be of general interest.

As I type I'm bringing up the 68K version of Opus 38 (now FTPable from
UCB-VAX) on a SUN running 4.1c.  There don't seem to be any major
problems so far, but the compiler doesn't run on a system with all the
net servers on it because it runs out of memory.  I've been told this
is because there's a bug in 4.1c that forces it to only use 1/2 of the
swap partition.  I'm having to run standalone to compile the compiler;
I don't yet know whether I'll be able to compile other stuff without
this rather extreme fix.

As I use the system more I will post more info to this group.

Well, sort of. We now have Macsyma running on a Motorola 68000 - based
system with 6 megabytes of real memory. The operating system is a 
Unisoft UNIX system, which has been ported to some large number (>65) boxes.  
The Pixel people were kind enough to lend us a machine with enough 
real memory to make virtual memory unnecessary.

It takes a long time to load up, but once running, it is quite responsive,
and appears to be about 60% of a VAX 11/780 in terms of CPU time. 

We have not shaken down everything, but since the source code is unchanged
from the VAX, we expect the bugs to be limited to lisp compilation
glitches, or differences between versions of the UNIX system.

 Added functions:
   (vputprop 'Vv_vector 'g_value 'g_indicator)
   (vget  'Vv_vector 'g_indicator)

  work just like putprop and get, but modify the vector property list.

 Also:
   you can determine which function is called by lisp to print a vector
 by placing the function to call on the vector's property list under
 indicator 'print'.  The  print function is called with two arguments:
 the vector and the port.
 
 For example:
=> (defun printv (v port)
      (patom "A vector of size " port)
      (print (vsize v) port))
printv
=> (setq xx (new-vector 10))
vector[40]
=> (vputprop xx 'printv 'print)

Here is the equivalent of Interlisp's control-H followed by OK in Franzlisp:
i.e. if you wish to interrupt a Franzlisp computation, browse around the state
and resume computation:

Hit DEL;
Browse;
(return t)

Franz now escapes UPPER case letters instead of lower case letters when
(status uctolc) is enabled, so that (read (print x)) is an identity operation
on atom printnames.  Also, we made (explode) conform to what maclisp does

  'setf' now knows about 'nthelem', and there are two new functions:

	(readdir 's_direct)
		returns a list of the contents of the directory s_direct.

	(dirp 's_name)

We at Ga Tech (ai group working under prof Janet Kolodner) have just gotten our
long awaited Symbolics Lisp Machine up and running and are trying to establish
some measure of compatability between Franz and Zeta Lisp (as appropriate).
Janet seems to recall some mention of a flavor package for Franz. Is this
Berkley based or can anyone provide some clues as to where to check next?

Also, when is the next release of Franz scheduled and what features will it
incorporate?

If the flavor package is non-existent, we will probably be forced to develop
one here and will, of course, be glad to pass anything useful along.

would be grateful if you could tell us of what your experiences have been with
making Franzlisp code work on the Symbolics machine. We would gladly share

Here at the Univ of Maryland, we do have an implementation of
flavors in Franz Lisp and have used it successfully in several
large systems.  It doesn't contain all the features of the Lisp
Machine Flavors, but it does implement all the major ones.  It is
also different in a few ways that are necessitated by the limitations
of Franz Lisp (shallow binding without invisible pointers or true
closures -- though closures may be in the very newest versions of
Franz -- we have opus 38.26).  The package uses a hashing scheme
for looking up methods, and the function <- which is used to send
a message to an object is written in C.  Together, this makes it
an efficient implementation.

We are currently working on a new policy for distributing flavors,
our other lisp packages and our window package.  When we have worked
it out, I will announce the details here.

Here is a random number generator i use.  It seems to work fairly well, but i have
not looked to closely at the statistics.  Since it will occasionally require
bignums, it is probably not the fastest either.  I was just looking for something
that was likely to be portable between LISP's.
I would be very interested in hearing your evaluation of it.

  When a vector is printed, the size in square brackets will be the number
of entries (not the number of bytes).  The size printed for vectori
objects will continue to be the number of bytes.

  Also, if the property of a vector is a list with the car being a non nil

symbol will be printed rather than 'vector' or 'vectori'.

A bug present in previous versions is also present in 38.66 of Franz.
cfasl fails (in most cases) to close the file it reads from.
Consequently, mysterious events occur when the maximum number of open
file descriptors is reached.

The fix is made in the file ffasl.c. "close(fildes)" should be
prepended to the two return sequences from (the Unix code for)
Lcfasl:

I am interested in connectons between Franz and SUN workstations.
Like how far along is Franz on the SUN?  Is there some package
which allows Franz on a VAX to use a SUN as a display device?

Any info on this matter would be appreciated.
Thnaks, Fred Lakin

  Several things have changed:

1) Bugs in the open coding of vectors have been fixed.

2) Minor re-organization of the compiler source code.

3) The routine to determine whether or not tail merging is
   possible underwent major modification.

4) Lexpr's are compiled differently, or rather the way lexpr args
   are accessed has changed.  For those that want to know, here is
   the nitty gritty:

     Consider a the following lexpr: (defun test nargs ...).
     The arguments to the lexpr are stacked on the name stack
     (low to high number), and then nargs is stacked.  The user
     is allowed to change the binding of 'nargs' to anything
     he likes, so we have to have another way to access the arguments
     on the name stack (i.e., other than an offset from nargs).
     Before, a pointer to the argument base was pushed on the 
     C stack, so that indexing could be done from there.
     The addressing modes used to do this are not available
     on the MC68000 (something like *n(fp)[Rx]), so now
     nargs is pushed on the name stack twice, and the location
     of an argument can be easily calculated as an offset from nargs.

In short, lots of thing changed.  The SUN's should be updated
in the next couple of days (after I test it out).  Bugs to me...

  If a vector has a 'unique' property on it's property list, then it will
not be copied by 'copy'.

  'untrace' will now autoload /usr/lib/lisp/trace.

  A number of functions and macros were contributed by the bair group:

 






(<= 'fx_arg1 'fx_arg2 ...)
(<=& 'x_arg1 'x_arg2)

     RETURNS: t iff (> 'fx_arg1 'fx_arg2)  [or  (>&  'x_arg1
              'x_arg2)]  is nil, otherwise nil.  The general
              function, <=, can take  more  than  two  argu-
              ments.

(>= 'fx_arg1 'fx_arg2)
(>=& 'x_arg1 'x_arg2)

     RETURNS: t  iff  (<  'fx_arg1  'fx_arg2  ...)  [or  (<&
              'x_arg1 'x_arg2)] is nil, otherwise nil.

     NOTE: The general function, >=, can take more than  two
           arguments.

(litatom 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is an atom, but not a number.

(nequal 'g_x 'g_y)

     RETURNS: t iff g_x is not equal to g_y, otherwise nil.

(lineread [['p_port] ['s_flag]])

     RETURNS: a list consisting of s-expressions on  a  line
              from  the  port p_port (or piport if p_port is
              not given).  If an s-expression (e.g., a list)
              takes more than one line, or a line terminates
              in a space or  tab,  then  lineread  continues
              reading until an expression ends at the end of
              a line.

     NOTE: If s_flag is t, then if the first character on  a
           line  is  a  newline, lineread performs a tyi and
           returns nil.  If s_flag is nil  or  not  present,
           lineread  does  a  read  skipping  over any blank
           lines to make sure that an s-expression is  actu-
           ally read.

     SIDE EFFECT: lineread uses  read,  advancing  the  port
                  character pointer.

(defv g_arg1 g_arg2)

     EQUIVALENT TO: (set g_arg1 g_arg2)

(pp-form 'g_form ['p_port] ['n_lmar])

     RETURNS: nil

     SIDE EFFECT: g_form  is  pretty-printed  to  the   port
                  p_port (or poport if p_port is not given).
                  If  pp-form  is  also  supplied  with   an
                  integer  (n_lmar),  that  integer  will be
                  used as a left margin setting  (0  is  the
                  default).   This is the  function which pp
                  uses (n_lmar = 0). pp-form does  not  look
                  for  function  definitions  or  values  of
                  variables, it just prints out the form  it
                  is given.

     NOTE: This is useful as a top-level-printer, c.f.  top-
           level in Chapter 6.

(sload 's_file1 ...)

     SIDE EFFECT: The files named are opened for reading and
                  each form is read, optionally printed, and
                  evaluated.

     NOTE: What sload prints is controlled  by  the  special
           atom  $sldprint.   If  $sldprint  is t (default),
           then if a form  is  recognizable  as  a  function
           definition,  only  the  function name is printed,
           otherwise  the  whole  form   is   printed.    If
           $sldprint is eq to value, then the result of each
           form's evaluation will also be printed.  Printing
           the  forms'  values  can be controlled by setting
           sload-print equal to the name of the function  to
           be  called.   sload recognizes named functions by
           looking at  the  sloadprintarg  property  of  the
           function  name.   The  value of the sloadprintarg
           property should be the  argument  number  of  the
           function name.  For the standard Franz Lisp func-
           tions, the properties are already set.

     EXAMPLE: (defprop def 1 sloadprintarg)   ; This is  the
              default--declaring that
                                              ; the name  of
              the function definition is the
                                              ; first  argu-
              ment.

          The functions described below are  an  alternative
     to  the  gensym facility.  They generate new symbols by
     attaching counter numbers to the ends of  the  symbols'
     names.   An  example  follows  of how the functions are
     used.


    ____________________________________________________

    (joe0 john5)
    -> (newsym john)                ; create a new symbol
    john6
    -> (newsym chuck)               ; symbol need not be initsym'ed
    chuck0
    -> (oldsym john)                ; get current symbol
    john6
    -> (allsym john)                ; get all symbols between 0 and counter

    (joe0 john6)
    -> (symstat joe john)
    ((joe nil) (john 3))
    ____________________________________________________




(initsym g_arg1 ...)

     WHERE:   g_argi is a  list  (n_counteri  s_argi)  or  a
              string  s_argi  (which  is  equivalent  to  (0
              s_argi)).

     RETURNS: a list of interned identifiers using the  sym-
              bol  counters  n_counteri, i.e., the result of
              concatenating s_argi to n_counteri.

     EXAMPLE: (initsym joe (john 5)) ==> (joe0 john5)

     NOTE: See also newsym, oldsym, allsym, remsym, and sym-
           stat functions.

(newsym s_arg)

     RETURNS: an interned identifier formed by concatenating
              the  name  s_arg  to  the  symbol  counter for
              s_arg.  The symbol counter is  stored  on  the
              property list of s_arg under symctr.  If there
              is no counter, a counter  of  0  is  used  and
              added  to  the  property list.  Thus, a symbol
              need not be initsymed.

     EXAMPLE: (initsym joe (john5)) ==> (joe0 john5)
              (newsym john) ==> john6
              (newsym joe) ==> joe1

     NOTE: See also initsym,  oldsym,  allsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(oldsym s_arg)

     RETURNS: the  identifier  using  the   current   symbol
              counter  for s_arg, rather than creating a new
              identifier.  If no symbol counter  exists  for
              s_arg, then s_arg is returned.

     NOTE: See also initsym,  newsym,  allsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(allsym g_arg)

     WHERE:   g_arg is a list (s_arg n_counter) or a  string
              s_arg (equivalent to (s_arg 0)).

     RETURNS: a list of all the created identifiers  between
              n_counter  and  the current symbol counter for
              s_arg.

     EXAMPLE: (allsym john) ==> (john0 john1 john2)

     NOTE: See also initsym,  newsym,  oldsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(remsym g_arg1 ...)

     WHERE:   g_argi is a  list  (s_argi  n_counteri)  or  a
              string  s_argi (which is equivalent to (s_argi
              0)).

     RETURNS: a list of symbols s_argi with the current sym-
              bol counters.

     SIDE EFFECT: remsym remob's all the created identifiers
                  between   zero   and  the  current  symbol
                  counter for s_argi.













     NOTE: See also initsym, newsym oldsym, allsym, and sym-
           stat functions.

(symstat s_arg1 ...)

     RETURNS: a list of pairs consisting of (s_argi symctri)
              where   symctri  is  s_argi's  current  symbol
              counter.

  evalhook and funcallhook can now be executed without setting (*rset t)
and (sstatus evalhook t).   Although they can be executed, they won't
have any effect unless and until (*rset t) and (sstatus evalhook t) are
done.
  The reason for this change is that now one can turn off stepping
by (sstatus evalhook nil) and then continue the evaluation with
evalhook and funcallhook.

  Those who use the new top-level 'tpl' will notice a few new commands
dealing with stepping when you type '?help'.   These new commands
are ?step, ?soff, and ?sc. Details of the commands are available
using the help mechanism (e.g. '?help step').

 The compiler will now compile the form
       (*no-macroexpand* <form>)
 in a special way: if <form> is a function call, e.g. (name arg1 ...),
 then any macro properties of 'name' will be ignored for this
 invocation.  This permits one to write macros which attempt
 an optimization, and if that fails, then call the standard
 function.  *no-macroexpand* is not a function that can be called,
 thus forms with *no-macroexpand* are likely to be 'cmacros'.
 Here is an example:

   (defcmacro length (x &protect (x))
       `(if (null ,x)
          then 0
	 elseif (null (cdr ,x))
	  then 1
	 else (*no-macroexpand* (length ,x))))


 [in case you are wondering, the `&protect (x)' means that
  should the actual argument to 'length' be a non atom, defcmacro
  will lambda bind the value, insuring that it is only evaluated
  once]

The function 'insert' in Opus 38.50 does not perform as advertised in

It still insists on putting the duplicate element into the list. The

  The 'error' function used to print its arguments and then call 'err' to
cause the familar 'call to err' error.  The problem with this is that
even if you wrap your compuatation with (errset ... nil), the error message
will still be printed.   In opus 38.77, this problem has been fixed.

A new function was added:
	(err-with-message 'st_message ['g_value])
 This causes an error to be signaled with the given message.   The message
will only be printed if an '(errset ... nil)' isn't being executed.
Normally nil is returned from an errset if an error occured.  If you provide
g_value, then it will be returned from the errset.
[Not surprisingly, 'error' now uses 'err-with-message']


Also, 'error' now takes any number of arguments.  In concatenates them,
separated by spaces, and this is the error message passed to
err-with-message.

Hello all:

I would be grateful if you could answer another question regarding Franzlisp.
How does one make Franzlisp continue from an error? For example when Lisp
gives an error message like "x unbound variable", is it possible to
bind x to a value and make Lisp continue from that point? Right now we have
to start over again and it is very time consuming.

 The new functions contributed by the bair group dealing with symbol
creation have been changed from fexprs to exprs (lambdas) and lexprs.

The new documentation follows:







     The functions described below are an alternative to the
gensym  facility.   They  generate  new symbols by attaching
counter numbers to the ends of the symbols' names.  An exam-
ple follows of how the functions are used.


    ____________________________________________________

    -> (initsym 'joe '(john 5))     ; initializing new symbol counters
    (joe0 john5)
    -> (newsym 'john)               ; create a new symbol
    john6
    -> (newsym 'chuck)              ; symbol need not be initsym'ed
    chuck0
    -> (oldsym 'john)               ; get current symbol
    john6
    -> (allsym 'john)               ; get all symbols between 0 and counter
    (john0 john1 john2 john3 john4 john5 john6)
    -> (allsym '(john 5))           ; get all symbols between 5 and counter
    (john5 john6)
    -> (remsym 'joe '(john 4))      ; remob all interned symbols
                                    ; associated with joe and from
                                    ; john4 to the current john
                                    ; symbol--returns symbols with symbol counters
                                    ; before doing remsym
    (joe0 john6)
    -> (symstat 'joe 'john)
    ((joe nil) (john 3))

(initsym 'g_arg1 ...)

     WHERE:   g_argi is a  list  (n_counteri  s_argi)  or  a
              string  s_argi  (which  is  equivalent  to  (0
              s_argi)).

     RETURNS: a list of interned identifiers using the  sym-
              bol  counters  n_counteri, i.e., the result of
              concatenating s_argi to n_counteri.

     EXAMPLE: (initsym 'joe '(john 5)) ==> (joe0 john5)

     NOTE: See also newsym, oldsym, allsym, remsym, and sym-
           stat functions.



















(newsym 's_arg)

     RETURNS: an interned identifier formed by concatenating
              the  name  s_arg  to  the  symbol  counter for
              s_arg.  The symbol counter is  stored  on  the
              property list of s_arg under symctr.  If there
              is no counter, a counter  of  0  is  used  and
              added  to  the  property list.  Thus, a symbol
              need not be initsymed.

     EXAMPLE: (initsym 'joe '(john5)) ==> (joe0 john5)
              (newsym 'john) ==> john6
              (newsym 'joe) ==> joe1

     NOTE: See also initsym,  oldsym,  allsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(oldsym 's_arg)

     RETURNS: the  identifier  using  the   current   symbol
              counter  for s_arg, rather than creating a new
              identifier.  If no symbol counter  exists  for
              s_arg, then s_arg is returned.

     NOTE: See also initsym,  newsym,  allsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(allsym 'g_arg)

     WHERE:   g_arg is a list (s_arg n_counter) or a  string
              s_arg (equivalent to (s_arg 0)).

     RETURNS: a list of all the created identifiers  between
              n_counter  and  the current symbol counter for
              s_arg.

     EXAMPLE: (allsym 'john) ==> (john0 john1 john2)

     NOTE: See also initsym,  newsym,  oldsym,  remsym,  and
           symstat functions.

(remsym 'g_arg1 ...)

     WHERE:   g_argi is a  list  (s_argi  n_counteri)  or  a
              string  s_argi (which is equivalent to (s_argi
              0)).

     RETURNS: a list of symbols s_argi with the current sym-
              bol counters.

     SIDE EFFECT: remsym remob's all the created identifiers
                  between   zero   and  the  current  symbol
                  counter for s_argi.













     NOTE: See also initsym, newsym oldsym, allsym, and sym-
           stat functions.

(symstat 's_arg1 ...)

     RETURNS: a list of pairs consisting of (s_argi symctri)
              where   symctri  is  s_argi's  current  symbol
              counter.

     NOTE: See also initsym,  newsym,  oldsym,  allsym,  and
           remsym functions.
