echo 'Look in a printed manual if you can for general help.  You should
have someone show you some things and then read one of the tutorial papers
(e.g. UNIX for Beginners or An Introduction to the C Shell) to get started.

The commands:
	man -k keyword		lists commands relevant to keyword
	man command		prints out the manual for a command
are helpful; other basic commands are:

	ex		- text editor
	finger		- user information lookup program
	ls		- list contents of directory
	mail		- send and receive mail
	msgs            - system messages and junk mail program
	passwd		- change login password
	tset		- set terminal modes
	who		- who is on the system
	write		- write to another user
You could find programs about mail by the command:	man -k mail
