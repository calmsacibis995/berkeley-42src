.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vacation
returns a message to the sender of a message
telling that you are on vacation.
The intended use is in a
.I \&.forward
file.
For example,
your
.I \&.forward
file might have:
.PP
.ti +5
\eeric, "|vacation eric"
.PP
which would send messages to you
(assuming your login name was eric)
and send a message back to the sender.
.PP
.I Vacation
expects a file
.I \&.vacation.msg
in your home directory containing a message to be sent back
to each sender.
For example, it might say:
.PP
.in +5
.nf
I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
please contact Joe Kalash (IngVAX:kalash).
	--eric
.fi
.in -5
.PP
This message will only be sent once a week to each unique
sender.
This timeout can be reset using the
.B \-t
flag;
a trailing `s', `m', `h', `d', or `w'
scales the number to seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks
respectively.
The people who have sent you messages are kept in the files
.I \&.vacation.pag
and
.I \&.vacation.dir
in your home directory.
The
.B \-I
option initializes these files,
and should be executed before you modify your
.I \&.forward
file.
.PP
If the
.B \-I
flag is not specified,
.I vacation
reads the first line from the standard input
for a \s-1UNIX\s0-style
``From'' line
to determine the sender.
If this is not present,
a nasty diagnostic is produced.
.IR Sendmail (8)
includes this automatically.
